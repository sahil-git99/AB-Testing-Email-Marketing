### Concept of A/B Testing

A/B testing refers to a process of experimentation, wherein two or more versions of a variable like web page, page element, etc. are shown to different segments of users at the same time to determine which version leaves the maximum impact and drive business metrics.

In A/B testing, A refers to ‘control’ or the original testing variable. Whereas B refers to ‘variation’ or a new version of the original testing variable.

We can perform the A/B test on the following:
   * Site Pages, Flow, and Elements
   * Business Model
   * Backend Functionality and Algorithms
   * New Products or Services

The benefits of using A/B tests are as follows:

  * Increase Revenue and Conversions
  * Rapid Iteration
  * Learn what works
  * Uses Actual Site Visitors
  * Data-Driven Decision Making


## Conclusions


**Testing at Users Level**

For Order Binary Metric
  * The test group 1 had 5 % more users with orders compared to test group 0
  * p-value for this lift is 0.05, which does not meet our threshold for significance
  * There is no statistically significant change to the Order Binary metric as a result of the treatment

**Testing at Items Level**

For View Item Metric
  * The test group 1 had 2.3 % more viewed items compared to test group 0
  * p-value for this lift is 0.25, which does not meet our threshold for significance
  * There is no statistically significant change to the View Item metric as a result of the treatment

For Order Binary Metric
  * In this case, p-value of 0.93 is observed
  * And the lift after treatment is - 0.5 % 
  * There is no statiscally significant change to the Order binary metric as a result of the treatment
